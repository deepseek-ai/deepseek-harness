# apps/web browser e2e

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

These tests boot the real web composition in-process and drive it with a real Chromium over real HTTP. The lane's mechanics — modes, fixtures, goldens, and the deliberate composition divergences from `dsh web` — are documented in [`scaffold.ts`](scaffold.ts) and the [browser e2e Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/testing/2026-07-24-web-gui-browser-e2e-lane.md).

## Completion observations

State-sensitive cases use Workspace, admission, attachment, and model-stream barriers to separate visible intermediate states from completed operations. Details close waits for frame transitions; archive verification assigns an explicit title to the seeded Session and follows that identity across reload. See the [CI fixture synchronization decision](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/testing/2026-09-08-ci-completion-observations.md).

## These are Host-face tests

They type-check in the root `tsconfig.host.json`, not in the Client aggregate, because they read Host services directly: `ctx.connection`, the Host `SessionStore`, and `ctx.sessionProjectionCache`. Driving a browser at runtime does not make a file part of the Client program — the two faces merge Cordis `Context` under the same keys with different services, so one program cannot see both. Moving these files into the Client aggregate makes every Host-service access fail to compile.

## Do not import `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-*` here

Importing a Client package — a value or a type — pulls its whole TypeScript project, and every project it references, into the **Host build graph**. That has bitten this lane once already: four Client consumer packages reference `api/remotes`' Client face, which cannot compile until Host tsdown has generated `@deepseek-ai/dsh-goal/remote`, so the Host build phase ended up waiting on an artifact it produces itself.

When a scenario needs a Client-owned constant or pure function, mirror it here instead, next to the commented-out import that names the source module. A drift then surfaces as a missed selector or a stale mirrored value — a loud failure, never a silent pass. `scaffold.ts` follows this rule for the welcome-notice namespace, acknowledgement field, version, and asserted Chinese copy.

The built-client harness is the exception. `assembled-boot.ts` imports `AppWebEntry`, the boot-manifest type, and `RemoteMock`; `assembled-remote.ts` imports the Client test runtime's default responses and `RemoteMock`. These packages are explicit project references for booting the real shell against a test-owned carrier. The chat scenarios mirror `conversationContextKey` in `support.ts` instead of importing its Client owner.

Nothing mechanically enforces this rule; keep it in review.
