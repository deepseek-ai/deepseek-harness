# guard/ — loop-hygiene guard family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `guard/` group keeps the agent loop productive by watching for two common failure patterns. `repeat-tool-reminder` notices when the model repeats the exact same tool call and reminds it to change approach or finish, so a stuck loop stops burning time and tokens. `timeout-policy` puts a time limit on tool calls that declare one, so a hung call returns a clear timed-out error to the model instead of stalling the session. Both ship enabled in the `dsh` base bundle; a composition can tune or remove them.

## Packages

Two small plugins cover the two patterns; each README below explains when to keep, tune, or remove it.

| Package | What it provides |
|---|---|
| [`repeat-tool-reminder/`](repeat-tool-reminder/README.md) | Reminds the model when it repeats the same tool call, so it changes approach or finishes |
| [`timeout-policy/`](timeout-policy/README.md) | Times out tool calls that declare a limit, so the model gets a clear error instead of waiting forever |
