/**
 * Adaptive chooser of the directory-picker seam: resolves the host's
 * situation once at boot (bind host, SSH launch, display session, Linux
 * chooser binary) and mounts the matching interaction — `native` or `browse`
 * — as real Loader entries in the in-memory root tree. Each interaction is a
 * pair: the Host backend serving the seam capability and the client surface
 * occupying ui-workspace's directory-flow holes. Both arrive as ordinary
 * entries, so the surface is discovered exactly as a config-row's would be
 * and one resolved choice still swaps both faces; pinning an interaction
 * remains composing that pair directly instead of this row.
