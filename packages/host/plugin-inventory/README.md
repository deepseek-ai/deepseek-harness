## Summary

Clients and settings pages can show what is currently composed in the host: calling `pluginInventory/list` returns the current non-group Loader entries in Loader order — entry id, module specifier, effective enablement, and root Fiber phase (`pending`, `loading`, `active`, `failed`, or `unloading`, or `null` when an entry has no live root Fiber). When an agent-preset roster is composed, the snapshot also carries one group per preset — id, trust, display name, default marking, health, and flattened composition rows — because a deployment that mounts the roster runs its model-facing plugins there rather than on the Loader's own entries. The snapshot is point-in-time: the Loader is the sole lifecycle authority, and this package owns no cache, history, provenance model, event stream, or mutation path. Client packages consume the Remote through the explicit [`api-remotes`](../../api/remotes/README.md) assembly rather than importing the Host implementation.

## Use this package

Call `pluginInventory/list` when a client or settings page needs to show what is currently composed in the host — which plugins are loaded, enabled, and alive, and what each agent preset would give a session. The Remote is the only entry point: the service is Remote-only and deliberately declares no same-process Cordis `Context` merge.

### What a snapshot contains

Each row is one non-group Loader entry: its entry id, the exact module specifier, the effective enablement (including disabled ancestor groups), and the current root Fiber phase. `pending` means the entry waits to load, `loading` that it is being read, `active` that it is running, `failed` that its fiber rejected, and `unloading` that it is being torn down; `null` means no live root Fiber exists at all. Structural group rows are skipped.

### Per-preset compositions

With a roster composed, `agentPresets` carries one group per preset in roster order: its id, whether the deployment ships it or the user owns it (`trust`, which clients use to localize shipped names), published display name, whether a session naming no preset composes it, and flattened plugin rows — entry id (null when the file row declares none), module specifier, effective enablement, the row's own `!!js` disabled expression when it carries one, and a root-fiber phase when the composition is live. A preset some session already composed answers from its newest standing generation — even when its file has since broken, because the mount is what those sessions run; one never composed since boot answers from its composition file with disabled gates evaluated against the Loader context, and reading never mounts a preset. `conditional` enablement marks a gate the Host could not evaluate, and a broken preset nothing composed stays listed with its reason and no rows. Without a roster the field is absent.

### What you can and cannot do with it

The inventory is a snapshot for display and diagnostics: a client can render the roster, flag failed entries, and detect changes by comparing snapshots. It cannot enable, disable, add, or remove plugins, and it carries no history — a fiber that already failed and was removed is absent. Because the service reads the Loader on every call, the answer always reflects the current composition rather than a cached view.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

### Design concept

The gateway is a direct projection with no second lifecycle truth: every `list()` call reads `ctx.loader.entries()` and maps each non-group entry to its public row. Cordis's internal plugin/status events already maintain `Entry.fiber` and `Fiber.state`, so a cache would only add another lifecycle truth to keep synchronized. The agent-preset roster is an optional peer resolved per call through `ctx.get('agentPresets')`: its `compositionInventory()` owns every preset read, and this package only maps root-fiber states onto the public phase vocabulary.

### The phase mapping

Fiber states map onto the public phase vocabulary, with `disposed` folding into `null` — an entry whose fiber is gone has no live root to report. The phase therefore never distinguishes why no live root exists: the entry may never have started, or its fiber may already have been disposed.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | `PluginInventoryGateway`: the `pluginInventory` Remote service and the Loader projection |
| [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts) | Public payload types: `PluginInventoryEntry`, `PluginInventorySnapshot`, `PluginFiberPhase` |
| — | No runtime invariant companion is published; every snapshot is projected directly from Loader-owned state. |

Typert generates the Host and Client Remote artifacts exposed by `./typert` and `./remote`.

## Further Exploration

Read these when the inventory contract is not enough: how the Remote reaches clients, then the Loader it projects and the surface that renders it.

- [Remote assembly](../../api/remotes/README.md) — how clients consume `pluginInventory/list` without importing the Host implementation.
- [Cordis plugin loader](../../../vendor/loader/README.md) — the Loader whose entries this package projects.
- [Plugin inventory settings surface](../../client/ui-settings-plugin-inventory/README.md) — the browser-side projection that renders the inventory.

## Model Experience

None, as the host-side read-only Loader projection registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define what a point-in-time inventory cannot tell a client. They are current package constraints, not a task backlog.

- **Point-in-time state only** — the result contains no durable failure history or subscription; a missing root Fiber is reported as `null`, regardless of why no live root exists.
- **No provenance or mutation** — the service does not identify which bundle, profile, or override introduced an entry, and it cannot enable, disable, add, or remove plugins in either plane.
- **Presets appear only with a roster** — a deployment without `dsh-agent-presets` serves Loader entries alone; the `agentPresets` field is absent rather than empty.
