/**
 * Abstract subprocess service. Subclass, implement {@link spawn}, and load the
 * subclass as a plugin — it registers as `ctx.subprocess` (one implementation
 * per context; loading a second throws, which is cordis' standard
 * duplicate-service behavior).
 *
 * Implementations must honor these semantics:
 * - Executable paths belong to one execution world shared with the mounted
 *   filesystem provider.
 * - {@link spawn} returns a live handle synchronously. Target identity remains
 *   provider-private; `done` resolves with the spawned command's exit facts and
 *   may reject for spawn or provider failures.
 * - Collect-mode readers are offset-based and non-consuming, so independent
 *   readers never consume one another's output; lossy reads report truncation
 *   and the spill file holding the complete stream when one exists. Piped
 *   streams are handed to the caller raw and never buffered here.
 * - {@link SubprocessHandle.terminate} (and the spec's abort signal) starts the
 *   provider's documented procedure against its managed range.
 *   {@link SubprocessHandle.waitForExit} observes that same range so a
 *   consumer-owned teardown ladder can hold each tier on real quiescence; each
 *   provider documents its signalling and observability limits.
 * - Disposal of the service terminates all still-running managed processes
 *   and awaits their exit.
 * - {@link spawnTerminal} owns terminal allocation, text transport,
 *   foreground groups, signalling, and whole-session quiescence behind one
 *   awaited termination method; readiness and persistent-shell policy stay
 *   in the PTY consumer. Its output stream ends after queued terminal output
 *   when the top-level process exits.
