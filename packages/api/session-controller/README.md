# Session Controller

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-session-controller` owns the Host `ctx.sessionController` service and the generated Client `session`, `skills`, and `fileReferences` Remote namespaces. It serves Session lifecycle and history, the Host-generation model catalog, workspace-path opening, user-invocable skill discovery, and Agent-scoped file references. Use it through API Gateway when a Client needs operations addressed by a Session.

## Use this package

History pages and follow opening snapshots carry one `{ type: 'event', event: SessionWireEvent }` record per durable Session event. The Client retains each accepted record as one durable `SessionEventLikeEntry`; Assistant token boundaries remain inside the compact stream on `assistant/message` or `assistant/attempt`. Tool arguments, result content, failures, and `tool/result.data.meta` pass through unchanged; the controller does not resolve a Tool definition, run a presenter, or attach UI data.

Each endpoint states its activation policy. List reads only stored headers and projection-cache rows: it never calls per-session stat or opens a cold Session body. A current-format cache identity may supply every list hint; a lifecycle-matching predecessor cache may supply only its version-compatible title as a stale display fact, never as an authoritative fold seed. Search, attachment, history pages, log following, skill discovery, and workspace-path opening can inspect persistence without activating an Agent; `canOpenWorkspacePath()` reports native-opening availability without addressing a Session. Queue mutation and cancellation require live state; model, rename, prompt, and file-reference operations may resolve or resume an ordinary Session. Prompt admission consumes opaque receipts from the injected [`fileUploads`](../../client/file-upload/README.md) Host service and resolves every same-Agent receipt before sending the complete ordered content list through `ctx.attachments`. Prompt retries whose `requestId` is already queued or logged return the original acceptance without inserting another message. Create and fork are the only operations that create a new Agent directly. The service applies one preset-aware resume policy and subagent ownership fence to its own methods and to the Typert Agent and Session lookups used by other Remote namespaces. Queue mutation has one narrow exception: a live child whose current projected identity is continuable and comes from its own non-seed suffix accepts the ordinary Edit, Remove, and QueueDock Steer actions across both inbox destinations. One-shot, missing, unknown, corrupt, seed-only, or cold children remain rejected without resume. The skill catalog uses a live Agent when present or the recorded preset's standing scope when cold, so listing never starts an Agent.

The Client adapter exposes `SessionEventStream`, a Gateway `RemoteJournalStream` bound to one ordinary or direct-subagent address. It opens follow before the initial page, publishes only contiguous `replace`, `prepend`, `append`, and `settle-assistant` changes, and repairs reconnect or sequence gaps through a tail page. Backwards paging has two verbs: `loadOlder()` pulls one 50-message page, and `loadThrough(seq)` — the turn-jump loader — loops 200-message pages until the window covers the target seq, lowering a shared target on repeated calls, stopping on a page that makes no progress, and reporting busy through the same `loadingOlder` snapshot bit. The Web adapter explicitly opts into cursorless Assistant frames: each opening carries the active attempt's `startedAfterSeq`, `nextIndex`, and compact stream, and every stream member becomes a Client-only `assistant/live-chunk` entry ordered between durable cursors. The Host captures a follower-local arrival ordinal with that baseline and suppresses buffered frames at or before the cut; a replacement Agent may restart frame revision at one. A durable `assistant/message` or `assistant/attempt` arriving after an active opening stays staged only when its seq follows `startedAfterSeq` and its Turn and Step match; the matching end type, seq, and index publishes one named settlement delta that retires the attempt's transient rows and adds the durable entry while earlier same-step retries remain visible. Revision, dense-index, or settlement gaps for a known attempt reopen follow, while a controller that missed the start ignores unknown-attempt frames and publishes their durable settlement normally. An abandoned end publishes a settlement delta without a durable entry so its transient rows retire immediately. A durable gap-repair page has no Assistant baseline, so its held notification reopens follow once for a paired page and baseline. Every history record covers exactly its event seq. A business, persistence, or unresolved continuity failure terminates the stream, while only physical carrier loss selects automatic resumption. `SessionControlStream` is a Gateway `RemoteSnapshotStream`; every generation opens with a complete process-local baseline, so reconnect replaces queue, jobs, and projection state instead of treating transient values as durable events. For each inbox change, the Host publishes the projection frame first and derives the queue replacement from that same validated post-fold value, so listener registration order cannot produce a stale queue frame.Client Agent contexts provide the identity used by the independent [`fileUpload`](../../client/file-upload/README.md) service; Session objects expose lifecycle, prompt, queue, and history operations rather than file transfer.

The Session object also carries local submission echoes: `session.beginSubmission` inserts one into `SessionSnapshot.pendingSubmissions` synchronously, before the caller serializes and prompts, so a conversation UI can show the message on the submit click's own frame. The echo stores ordered image previews and durable file references. Session derives its `transcript`, `queued`, or `steering` placement from the current running state and requested delivery mode, then retains that placement while serialization is in flight. The prompt's `requestId` is the correlation identity: the Host echoes it as the durable user source's `rpcId`, and queue occurrences project it as `SessionQueuedItem.rpcId`. An echo retires one animation frame after its durable event or queue occurrence is observed, immediately when its identified prompt fails or is abandoned, and as failed on disposal. Each retirement fires `onRetire` exactly once; an observed retirement includes the ordered durable attachment references so the composer can release successful cards while preserving failed drafts. Echoes are Client memory only; reload and reconnect rebuild the conversation from durable events alone.

## Model Experience

None, as invoked Agent commands own any model-visible effect.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct effect; model requests remain owned by the Agent and LLM packages.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- Control baselines represent process-local state and therefore cannot reconstruct jobs after a Host restart.
- A failed follow resumption remains visible to the caller instead of retrying indefinitely.
- The raw browser upload is one streaming HTTP request without resumable offsets; a retry sends the file again from byte zero.
- File-reference completion uses the shared Agent lookup and can resume a cold Session; the `skills/list` catalog is the non-activating alternative for skill metadata.
