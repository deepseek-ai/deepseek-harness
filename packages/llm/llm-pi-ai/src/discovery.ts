/**
 * Answering "which models can this provider serve?" for the configuration
 * surface's "fetch available models" action.
 *
 * A route the installed pi-ai catalog ships is answered **from that catalog**,
 * with no network call at all: pi-ai's registry is the authoritative list for
 * its own providers, and it carries the capacities a listing endpoint would
 * not disclose. Only a route the catalog does not describe — a gateway, a
 * self-hosted server — is interrogated over the wire.
 *
 * Neither path is a catalog refresh. Nothing here is stored: the request
 * carries a draft the user is still editing, and the reply is candidate
 * metadata the surface offers for adoption. `settings.yaml` remains the only
 * thing that decides what a route serves.
 *
 * Only OpenAI-compatible protocols are interrogated. Their listing is the one
 * shape a gateway, a self-hosted server, and the official endpoints all agree
 * on, which is the case this action exists for; every other protocol reports
 * that it cannot be interrogated so the surface falls back to hand-entry
 * rather than guessing a response shape.
