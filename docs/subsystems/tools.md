# Tools

English | [中文](tools.zh.md)

The tool pipeline of [dsh-tools](../../packages/core/tools). [core.md](core.md) introduces `ToolDefinition` as the pipeline-authoring type shared by the core packages; the model-facing [`ToolSchema`](llm-streaming.md#the-model-request-and-result) wire type is declared with the model request. This page documents every `ToolDefinition` field, the typed schema DSL that builds it, the guarded execution types, and the UI-presentation types.

## `ToolDefinition` — a registered tool

A `ToolSchema` (the model-facing fields) plus a mandatory canonical output declaration, the `execute` function, host-only scheduler metadata, an optional final-content callback, and optional UI presenters. The registry holds these; the loop dispatches calls through them. The registry's `schemas()` builds the model-facing `ToolSchema[]` by an explicit allowlist — `output`/`execute`/`projectContent`/`finalizeContent`/`timeoutMs`/`isConcurrencySafe`/`presentCall`/`presentResult` must never leak into a model request.

```ts type-equiv
/** Tool-owned canonical output contract used after the body returns a JSON value. */
interface ToolOutputDefinition {
  /** Raw supported JSON Schema enforced against every successful canonical value. */
  readonly schema: JsonSchemaNode
  /** Pure projection from validated arguments and value to Native/model content. */
  render(args: unknown, value: JsonValue): ContentBlock[]
  /** Pure replayable presentation projection, computed only for top-level calls. */
  presentationMeta?(args: unknown, value: JsonValue): JsonValue
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** A registered tool: its schema plus the execution function. */
interface ToolDefinition extends ToolSchema {
  /** Mandatory canonical output declaration. */
  readonly output: ToolOutputDefinition
  /**
   * Run one accepted call and return only its canonical lossless-JSON value.
   * Async work must observe or forward `exec.signal` and settle only after its
   * owned work reaches quiescence. The registry preserves caller cancellation
   * through around-dispatch signal replacement and does not abandon this
   * promise, but it cannot hard-kill same-process code.
   * @param args - losslessly snapshotted, frozen model arguments.
   * @param exec - execution identity, cancellation signal, and context deferral.
   * @returns the canonical value declared by `output.schema`.
   */
  execute(args: unknown, exec: ToolRunContext): Promise<unknown>
  /**
   * Install execution-prepared content before `tools/post-execute` policies.
   * The callback is captured when the call starts and runs once for a
   * normalized outcome entering post-execute. Policy replacements remain
   * authoritative; pipeline failures that bypass post-execute skip projection.
   * @param exec - immutable execution identity and arguments.
   * @param result - normalized result before post-execute policy.
   * @returns replacement content, or undefined to preserve the renderer output.
   */
  projectContent?(exec: Readonly<ToolExecution>, result: Readonly<ToolExecutionResult>): ContentBlock[] | undefined
  /**

   * snapshots this callback when execution starts and invokes it exactly once

   */
  timeoutMs?: number

  isConcurrencySafe?(args: unknown): boolean

   * or `undefined` (or omit the method) to fall back to a generic presentation
   * (title = tool name, raw args as input). Pure and side-effect-free: a UI may
   * call it during live streaming AND a session-log replay, so it must depend
   * only on `args`.
   */
  presentCall?(args: unknown): ToolCallView | undefined
  /**
   * Optional: how to present the COMPLETED state, given the same `args` and the
   * durable result projection (`content`, failure state, and optional `meta`). Returns a
   * {@link ToolResultView}, or `undefined` (or omit the method) to keep the

   * for the same replay reason.
   */
  presentResult?(args: unknown, result: ToolResult): ToolResultView | undefined
}
```

`execute` receives `args: unknown` — a raw `ToolDefinition` validates its own input. First-party tools don't write that by hand; they use `defineTool`, which validates and narrows the arguments, infers the body return from `output.schema`, and types both output projectors. `finalizeContent` deliberately receives the immutable execution instead of typed arguments because invalid-input and outer pipeline failures reach it too; it may enforce a tool-owned content bound while preserving `isError`, canonical value, structured error identity, deferred contexts, and presentation metadata.

## The unified JSON-value schema DSL

Plugin authors use one vocabulary for typed parameters and typed output values. `ValueSchemaSpec` supports `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `null`, `array`, `object`, author-only `json`, and exact-one `oneOf`; scalar `enum` and `const` values must match their node type. An explicit object node always declares `additionalProperties: true | false`. Parameter definitions remain an implicit open object property map, with `required: true` attached to each required property.

Source: [`packages/core/tools/src/schema.ts`](../../packages/core/tools/src/schema.ts)

```ts type-equiv
/** One author-facing schema for any lossless JSON value root. */
type ValueSchemaSpec =
  | StringValueSchemaSpec
  | NumberValueSchemaSpec
  | IntegerValueSchemaSpec
  | BooleanValueSchemaSpec
  | NullValueSchemaSpec
  | ArrayValueSchemaSpec
  | ObjectValueSchemaSpec
  | JsonValueSchemaSpec
  | OneOfValueSchemaSpec
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One implicit parameter-root property, optionally required. */
type ParameterPropertySpec = ValueSchemaSpec & { required?: true }
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Tool parameter schema. The map itself is an implicit open object root;
 * requiredness remains a per-property `required: true` annotation.
 */
type ParameterSchemaSpec = {
  [key: string]: ParameterPropertySpec
  [key: symbol]: never
}
```

`{ type: 'json' }` infers `JsonValue` and compiles to an annotation-only unconstrained raw schema. Output roots can be objects, arrays, scalars, or null. `InferValue<S>` honors literal constraints and object openness through 16 container levels, then falls back to `JsonValue` instead of exhausting TypeScript's type-instantiation stack. `InferArgs<P>` turns per-property requiredness into required and optional string keys:

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Infer the TypeScript value accepted by an author-facing value schema. Exact
 * inference is bounded to 16 container levels, then falls back to `JsonValue`.
 */
type InferValue<S> = InferValueAt<S, []>
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Infer the TypeScript argument object for an implicit parameter schema. */
type InferArgs<S> = InferProperties<S, []>
```

`defineTool({ name, description, parameters, output, execute, … })` ties parameter inference to `parameterSchemaSpecToJsonSchema()` and `validateArgs()`, and ties `execute`/`render`/`presentationMeta` to `InferValue<OutputSchema>`. Schema records contain only own enumerable string keys, and schema arrays are dense intrinsic arrays, so inference, compilation, and validation observe the same declaration. Inference stays exact through 16 container levels and then widens to `JsonValue`; runtime validation keeps walking the complete schema. `valueSchemaSpecToJsonSchema()` compiles output declarations through the same enforced raw subset. A parameter mismatch throws `ToolArgsError` (`INVALID_ARGS`); an invalid body or post-policy value throws `ToolOutputError` (`INVALID_TOOL_OUTPUT`). Both use the normal tool-error path. Raw JSON Schema remains open by default; unsupported keywords reject instead of being accepted without enforcement.

Registration is a trusted same-process contract. The registry borrows the typed definition as readonly input, requires `output`, validates its raw schema, and checks semantic requirements such as a positive finite `timeoutMs`; `schemas()` constructs the model-facing projection when building a request, so execution and presentation share one resolved definition without leaking callbacks onto the wire.

## `ToolRestriction` — one scope's live filter over what it inherits

`ToolRestriction` applies to the tools a scope inherits: the deployment-global layer plus every ancestor scope on its chain. The registry compiles readonly names into private sets, intersects multiple restrictions, then overlays the scope's OWN registrations, which stay exempt so a delegated child keeps the tools it answers through. A deny-only filter admits later unlisted inherited tools, while an allow-list excludes them.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Per-scope filter over global tools. Restrictions intersect and do not affect
 * scoped registrations or the reserved PTC mode transport.
 */
interface ToolRestriction {
  /** Global tool names that stay visible; everything else is removed. */
  readonly allow?: readonly string[]
  /** Global tool names removed from visibility. */
  readonly deny?: readonly string[]
}
```

## Execution: extensible waterfalls plus monotonic policy

`ctx.tools.execute()` accepts a caller-owned `ToolExecutionInput` with a required readonly `signal`, materializes its parsed JSON arguments once into a pipeline-owned `ToolExecution`, and runs that call through `tools/pre-execute` (the reorderable allow/deny/ask waterfall) → registered monotonic guards → `tools/execute` (around-dispatch wrappers) → `projectContent` → `tools/post-execute` (inspect/replace the result) → optional definition-owned `finalizeContent` → `tools/result` (the immutable authoritative outcome). Only the `tools/execute` view may replace the required signal. The outcome is a `ToolExecutionResult`.

```ts type-equiv
/** Opaque call identity that permits correlation without exposing mutable execution state. */
type ToolExecutionToken = symbol & { readonly [toolExecutionTokenBrand]: true }
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Caller-supplied description of one tool call. {@link ToolRuntime.execute}
 * adds the registry-owned token to form a pipeline {@link ToolExecution};
 * callers do not choose that token.
 */
interface ToolExecutionInput {
  readonly callId: ToolCallId
  /**
   * Root model-requested call owning this execution tree. Callers omit it for
   * a root execution; nested dispatchers propagate the enclosing value.
   */
  readonly rootCallId?: ToolCallId
  readonly name: string
  /** Binding-time tool schema for a PTC inner call; frozen by its producer and never logged. */
  readonly schema?: ToolSchema
  /** Losslessly JSON-serializable parsed arguments (tools validate their own schema). */
  readonly arguments: unknown
  /** The agent on whose behalf the call runs (set by the agent loop). */
  readonly agent?: Agent
  /**
   * Opaque token of the enclosing transport execution, when one exists. PTC
   * mode sets this on SDK sub-dispatches so commit-style observers can wait for
   * the outer `run_code` outcome without receiving its live mutable execution.
   * The token also marks the call as a transport sub-dispatch rather than a
   * model-direct call: under `mode: 'ptc'`, only calls WITH a parent may
   * execute a native tool name — a model-direct call (no parent) is denied as
   * `UNKNOWN_TOOL` before the policy pipeline. See {@link ToolRuntime.execute}.
   */
  readonly parent?: ToolExecutionToken
  /** Required caller-owned cancellation for this invocation. */
  readonly signal: AbortSignal
}
```

A tool body receives the runtime extension. `deferContext()` attaches context to the execution's own result — the composite-tool nested-dispatch channel, also usable by a leaf tool minting a plugin-sourced instruction — without injecting inside the still-open outer call.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Runtime context handed to a tool implementation after the registry has
 * accepted a {@link ToolExecution}. {@link deferContext} attaches context to
 * this execution's own result — a composite tool ferries nested-dispatch
 * context back to the outer result, and a leaf tool may mint a fresh
 * plugin-sourced instruction; the loop appends it only after the
 * `tool/result`.
 */
interface ToolRunContext extends ToolExecution {
  /**
   * Defer one context — typically a nested-dispatch context ferried by a
   * composite tool, or a fresh plugin-sourced instruction — until this tool's
   * final result reaches the agent loop. Contexts retain their individual
   * source and metadata and are emitted in call order.
   */
  deferContext(context: UserMessage): void
  /**
   * Mark a successful final result as terminal for the current agent turn.
   * The marker rides this execution's own result (`concludesTurn` exists only
   * on {@link ToolExecutionSuccess}); a composite that dispatches nested
   * calls forwards it from the nested result, exactly like
   * `additionalContexts`, so only an authoritative nested success can
   * conclude the enclosing run.
   */
  concludeTurn(): void
}
```

The agent loop asks the registry for each pending call's execution mode and uses it to form exclusive barriers and rolling-pool parallel runs:

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Scheduling mode for one pending call. `parallel` may overlap with siblings;
 * `exclusive` runs alone and forms an ordering barrier.
 */
type ToolExecutionMode =
  | { kind: 'parallel' }
  | { kind: 'exclusive' }
```

PTC bindings freeze their ToolSchema at construction and pass it through the scheduler into `ToolExecution.schema`; it is transient execution metadata. Before policy, each actually started sub-dispatch records only pairing ids, name, and normalized arguments. Neither start nor settle events serialize description, parameters, or schema. The bridge later exposes the settled call to the `tools/ptc-dispatch-log` waterfall, which may change the durable content copy while preserving the program value, model-visible outer result, and structured failure identity:

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One settled `run_code` sub-dispatch about to be logged, as seen by the
 * `tools/ptc-dispatch-log` waterfall: the parent execution (session owner,
 * outer call identity), the sub-call identity, and the outcome whose durable
 * copy a listener may reshape. `content` is the RENDERED result projection
 * (what a native `tool/result` would carry) — the program itself received
 * the structured `value` (or just the error message on failure); only the
 * `tool/ptc-dispatch` event's copy changes.
 */
interface PtcDispatchLog {
  /** The outer `run_code` execution. */
  readonly exec: ToolExecution
  /** The calling agent (the scope routing key and the spill owner), when the outer call has one. */
  readonly agent?: Agent
  /** Opaque sub-call id; new calls use `<parent>:ptc:<n>`. */
  readonly subCallId: ToolCallId
  /** The dispatched sub-tool name. */
  readonly name: string
  /** Whether the sub-call settled as an error. */
  readonly isError: boolean
  /** The sub-call's complete model-facing content (the settle event's default payload). */
  readonly content: ContentBlock[]
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One pending tool call inside the registry pipeline. Parsed arguments cross
 * one lossless-JSON materialization boundary before policy and are deep-frozen;
 * call identity, the caller signal, and the registry-assigned {@link token} are
 * readonly. The registry freezes the complete object before `tools/result`
 * observers run.
 */
interface ToolExecution extends ToolExecutionInput {
  /** Root model-requested call, resolved for every root and nested execution. */
  readonly rootCallId: ToolCallId
  /** Registry-assigned identity shared with nested calls only as their opaque `parent` token. */
  readonly token: ToolExecutionToken
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Around-dispatch view of a {@link ToolExecution}. A `tools/execute` wrapper
 * may replace the signal for its delegated lifetime, but it cannot remove it.
 * The registry fuses every replacement with the captured caller signal.
 */
interface ToolDispatchExecution extends Omit<ToolExecution, 'signal'> {
  /** Cancellation signal visible to the next wrapper or tool body. */
  signal: AbortSignal
}
```

`ToolExecutionToken` is an opaque runtime `Symbol` used only for identity comparison. Before policy, `execute()` materializes and freezes arguments, rejects non-JSON input, and assigns the token. Identity fields, the required caller signal, and the optional parent token remain readonly. A `ToolDispatchExecution` wrapper may replace but not remove the signal; the registry re-fuses the caller signal before invoking the body. Final observers receive the frozen execution identity.

A `ToolGuard` is scope-aware final pre-dispatch policy. Its return type deliberately has no allow result: `undefined` preserves the waterfall decision, while a returned reason can only reduce permission, so a later listener cannot undo it.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * A monotonic execution guard evaluated after every `tools/pre-execute`
 * listener and before the tool body. Returning a reason denies the call;
 * returning `undefined` leaves it unchanged. Because guards have no allow
 * result, listener ordering cannot turn a denial back into permission.
 * @param execution - the identity-protected call after extensible pre-execute policy completed.
 * @returns a final denial reason, or `undefined` to leave the call allowed.
 */
type ToolGuard = (execution: Readonly<ToolExecution>) => string | undefined
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Canonical failure detail; internal routing information remains optional. */
interface ToolFailure {
  /** Human-readable failure message without the Native `Error: ` envelope. */
  message: string
  /** Internal error class/code used by policy and durable diagnostics. */
  info?: ToolErrorInfo
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Successful canonical tool execution, including its Native/model projection. */
interface ToolExecutionSuccess {
  readonly isError: false
  /** Execution-local canonical value; deliberately omitted from durable events. */
  readonly value: JsonValue
  readonly content: ContentBlock[]
  readonly error?: never
  readonly meta?: JsonValue
  readonly additionalContexts?: UserMessage[]
  /** The agent loop stops after committing this successful result batch. */
  readonly concludesTurn?: true
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Failed canonical tool execution; failures never carry a successful value. */
interface ToolExecutionFailure {
  readonly isError: true
  readonly error: ToolFailure
  readonly value?: never
  readonly content: ContentBlock[]
  readonly meta?: JsonValue
  readonly additionalContexts?: UserMessage[]
  readonly concludesTurn?: never
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** The discriminated, execution-local outcome of one tool call. */
type ToolExecutionResult = ToolExecutionSuccess | ToolExecutionFailure
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Structured error metadata for a failed tool call (alongside the model-facing text). */
interface ToolErrorInfo {
  name: string
  code: string
  /** Optional raw user-facing detail; durable projections preserve it but model-facing content does not include it. */
  reason?: string
}
```

The result carries only the outcome. Call identity remains on the immutable `ToolExecution` that accompanies it through every hook and on the durable `tool/call` / `tool/result` session events, so wrappers cannot create a second, disagreeing identity. The canonical `value` is execution-local: the loop persists only `content`, `error`, and `meta`, while `tool/ptc-dispatch` stores the sub-call's rendered `content`, `isError`, and optional structured `error`. Replay reproduces presentation but cannot reconstruct canonical intermediate values. Optional `ToolErrorInfo.reason` retains raw user-facing detail without adding it to model-facing content.

On success the registry snapshots and validates the body value, freezes it, and invokes the pure renderer plus the optional top-level-call metadata projector. It separately materializes the durable presentation fields immediately before `tools/result`; an invalid value, renderer/projector failure, or non-JSON presentation becomes a JSON-safe `isError`. The final live observer therefore sees the exact execution-local value beside fields safe for the later durable append.

Before final content, the registry materializes the candidate result; a failure in content, structured error, additional context, or presentation metadata becomes a JSON-safe `isError` result that still reaches `finalizeContent`. The registry invokes that callback exactly once, then materializes and freezes the accepted result immediately before `tools/result`, so the observed live outcome is safe for the later durable `tool/result` append.

Each interception waterfall returns a typed **Decision** (the idiom shared with the `agent/*` waterfalls). `tools/pre-execute` listeners receive `(exec, next)` and return a `PreToolDecision`; `tools/execute` wrappers return a `ToolExecutionResult`; `tools/post-execute` listeners receive `(exec, result, next)` and return a `PostToolDecision`:

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Pre-dispatch decision. `allow` runs the call; `deny` materializes its
 * model-facing reason and optional structured error identity; `cancel` selects
 * the canonical cancellation result without presenting a policy denial; `ask`
 * runs only after an approval service returns `allowed-once` and otherwise
 * denies; its `reason` is the audited approval reason and its optional
 * `displayReason` is the localized prompt text. Input rewriting is excluded because arguments are already logged and
 * presented.
 */
type PreToolDecision =
  | { kind: 'allow' }
  | { kind: 'deny'; reason: string; info?: ToolErrorInfo }
  | { kind: 'cancel' }
  | { kind: 'ask'; reason?: string; displayReason?: { readonly en: string; readonly [locale: string]: string } }
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Post-dispatch decision: accept, replace one projection, attach context for the
 * next request, or block by turning corrective feedback into an error result.
 */
type PostToolDecision =
  | { kind: 'accept'; content?: ContentBlock[]; value?: never; additionalContexts?: UserMessage[] }
  | { kind: 'accept'; value: JsonValue; content?: never; additionalContexts?: UserMessage[] }
  | { kind: 'block'; feedback: ContentBlock[]; additionalContexts?: UserMessage[] }
```

Call `next()` for the default or return a decision to short-circuit. Pre-policy may deny or ask; only `allowed-once` proceeds, while a non-grant, missing approval channel or service, or agent-less request becomes a denial. A deny may attach structured identity and user-facing detail without changing its model-facing reason. Guards may still impose a final denial. Arguments cannot be rewritten because history, audit, UI, and execution must agree.

Post-policy may replace either content or value, never both. Content replacement preserves the canonical value and existing metadata; value replacement is revalidated and recomputes content/metadata; a block removes the value and becomes an `isError` containing corrective feedback. Content replacement is presentation policy, not confidentiality policy: a listener that must hide the programmatic value blocks or replaces it. `tools/result` receives the frozen execution and result after normalization; observers cannot transform them, and observer failures are contained. Unknown and throwing tools both become structured errors (`ToolNotFoundError` maps to `UNKNOWN_TOOL`), so the call fails without ending the turn.

## The enforced raw JSON Schema subset

Raw schemas from subagents, workflows, MCP, and dynamic registrations use the wire-level counterpart of the author DSL. `assertSupportedJsonSchema()` accepts any JSON root, `validateJsonSchemaValue()` enforces it, and `JsonSchemaError` reports every unsupported or malformed schema path. The empty annotation-only node means unconstrained lossless JSON. `oneOf` requires at least two branches and a value must match exactly one. Consumers that still require an object root call `assertObjectJsonSchema()` and carry `ObjectJsonSchema`; this is how subagent/workflow caller-defined structured output remains object-rooted without restricting the shared vocabulary.

```ts type-equiv
/** Scalar JSON values supported by `enum` and `const`. */
type JsonSchemaScalar = string | number | boolean | null
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Single-type keywords accepted by the enforced subset. */
type JsonSchemaType = 'object' | 'array' | 'string' | 'number' | 'integer' | 'boolean' | 'null'
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One raw JSON Schema node in the enforced subset. The optional fields express
 * the external wire schema; {@link assertSupportedJsonSchema} rejects invalid
 * combinations before a caller treats the node as trusted.
 */
interface JsonSchemaNode {
  /** Omit with no constraints for any JSON value, or use `oneOf`. */
  type?: JsonSchemaType
  /** Exactly one branch must validate; at least two branches are required. */
  oneOf?: JsonSchemaNode[]
  /** Nested property schemas (`type: 'object'` only). */
  properties?: Record<string, JsonSchemaNode>
  /** Required property names; each must appear in `properties`. */
  required?: string[]
  /** `false` rejects undeclared keys; absent/`true` follows JSON Schema's open default. */
  additionalProperties?: boolean
  /** Item schema (`type: 'array'` only); absent accepts any JSON item. */
  items?: JsonSchemaNode
  /** Allowed values for a scalar node. */
  enum?: JsonSchemaScalar[]
  /** The single allowed value for a scalar node. */
  const?: JsonSchemaScalar
  /** Annotation, ignored for validation. */
  description?: string
  /** Annotation, ignored for validation. */
  title?: string
  /** Annotation, ignored for validation but required to be lossless JSON. */
  default?: JsonValue
  /** Annotation, ignored for validation but required to be lossless JSON. */
  examples?: JsonValue
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** A consumer-constrained object-rooted schema. */
type ObjectJsonSchema = JsonSchemaNode & { type: 'object' }
```

## Tool-presentation UI vocabulary

How a tool wants its call shown in a UI (an editor tool-call card, a CLI log line), provider-neutral so a tool describes itself without depending on any client protocol. `presentCall`/`presentResult` return a **`card`-tagged render intent** — a discriminated union a UI bridge switches on:

- `ToolCallView` (pending): `{ card: 'generic', title, kind?, rawInput?, content?, locations? }` (the default card; `locations` is `{ path, line? }[]` files the call reads/modifies, for editor follow-along), `{ card: 'terminal', title, description?, cwd? }` (a shell command → a terminal card), or `{ card: 'diff', title, diffs, locations? }` (a file create/modify → an inline diff card; `diffs` is `{ path, oldText, newText }[]`, `oldText: null` for a new file).
- `ToolResultView` (completed): `{ card: 'generic', title?, content? }`, `{ card: 'terminal', title?, output?, exitCode?, signal? }` (the captured run output + exit; a capable UI shows an exit-status pill, while another may derive a fenced ` ```console ` fallback), `{ card: 'diff', title?, diffs }` (a completed file mutation → the change to show, typically the applied hunks with context lines computed from the before/after content, or a whole-file diff when there is no before-image), `{ card: 'search', shape, title?, truncated, total, … }` (a completed discovery search → grouped-by-file matches for `shape: 'matches'` (grep) or a flat path list for `shape: 'paths'` (glob); `truncated`/`total` report whether the inline result was capped so a UI never presents a partial result as complete; the view carries no result text — a UI without a search card falls back to the raw result content), `{ card: 'read', title?, path, offset, lines, totalLines, lang?, content? }` (a completed file read → a line-numbered, optionally syntax-highlighted code view; `offset` is the 1-based first line the window requested, kept even when `lines` is empty; `lang` is a language hint from the extension, and `content` is the envelope-stripped text a UI without read support falls back to), or `{ card: 'web', kind: 'search' | 'fetch', title?, … }` (a completed web retrieval; `kind: 'search'` carries the structured `sources`/`answer?`/`truncated`, `kind: 'fetch'` carries `url`/`statusCode`/`truncated`, and a UI without the `web` capability falls back to the raw result content — the body is not duplicated into the view). Completed views replace pending views, so mutation tools return a diff result even when it duplicates the call-time snippet; a search and a web retrieval have no `card` call-time analogue (their pending state stays a generic card, since the structured result exists only after `execute`).

`ToolCallKind` (`'read' | 'edit' | 'delete' | 'move' | 'search' | 'execute' | 'fetch' | 'other'`) picks an icon on a generic card. `FileLocation` (`{ path, line? }`), `FileDiff` (`{ path, oldText, newText }`), and `ReadFileLine` (`{ number, text }`, one 1-based numbered line of a read window) are the shared file-card vocabulary. The design is pinned in [the render-intent-union Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-02-tool-render-intent-union.md); host/client runtimes project this neutral vocabulary into their own views.

The full presentation field docs live in [`packages/core/tools/src/presentation.ts`](../../packages/core/tools/src/presentation.ts). The `bash` schema and executor are on [shell.md](shell.md); generic background controls are on [jobs.md](jobs.md).

Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.tools` — `ToolRuntime`

Tool registry and execution pipeline. Scoped registrations shadow globals; one visibility resolver feeds presentation, lookup, and dispatch.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Present the calling scope's tools in `mode` instead of the deployment
 * default. Nearest scope on the chain wins, so a preset's standing
 * declaration covers every agent joined under it.
 *
 * Scoped only, and one declaration per scope: this is how an agent preset
 * composes PTC mode agents beside native ones in the same process, and a
 * process-global override would be the `mode` config field instead.
 * @param mode - the presentation the covered agents' models see.
 * @returns the exact disposer that restores the deployment default.
 */
presentAs(mode: ToolPresentationMode): () => void

/**
 * Register globally or in the calling agent scope. Scoped tools shadow
 * globals; duplicates within one layer and the reserved `run_code` name fail.
 * @param definition - tool schema, execution, and optional finalization/presentation callbacks.
 * @returns the exact disposer that unregisters the tool.
 */
register(definition: ToolDefinition): () => void

/**
 * Restrict global tools for the calling agent scope. Empty filters, unknown
 * names, scope-local names, and reserved transport names fail. Restrictions
 * intersect; scoped registrations remain visible.
 * @param filter - global-tool mask: `allow` (keep only) and/or `deny` (remove).
 * @returns the exact disposer that lifts this restriction.
 */
restrict(filter: ToolRestriction): () => void

/**
 * Register a monotonic guard after the extensible `tools/pre-execute`
 * waterfall. A plain-context guard applies globally; one registered through
 * `agent.ctx` applies only to that agent. Any matching guard may deny by
 * returning a reason, while no guard can force-allow a call another guard
 * denied. The exact effect disposer is returned for ordered ownership and
 * HMR cleanup.
 * @param guard - synchronous check; a returned string denies the execution.
 * @returns the exact disposer that unregisters the guard.
 */
guard(guard: ToolGuard): () => void

/**
 * Look up a tool as one scope sees it (scoped
 * shadows global; a restricted-away global reads as absent). Presenters pass
 * the calling agent so the rendered card matches the definition that
 * actually executed.
 * @param name - the tool name as registered.
 * @param scope - the viewing scope (the agent); omitted = the global view.
 * @returns the definition the scope resolves, or undefined when none is visible.
 */
get(name: string, scope?: ScopeKey): ToolDefinition | undefined

/**
 * Project visible definitions onto the allowlisted model-facing schema fields,
 * excluding execution and presentation callbacks.

 * @returns one deep-cloned schema per visible tool.
 */
schemas(scope?: ScopeKey): ToolSchema[]

/**
 * Classify a pending call through the caller's visible tool definition. Only
 * an exact `true` is parallel; unknown, hidden, undeclared, invalid, or
 * throwing classifiers are exclusive.
 * @param exec - call name, parsed arguments, and optional agent scope.
 * @returns the fail-closed scheduling mode.
 */
executionMode(exec: ToolExecutionInput): ToolExecutionMode

/**
 * Execute through pre-policy, guards, around-dispatch, post-policy,
 * definition-owned content finalization, and final notification. Tool and
 * listener failures resolve as materialized error results; an invisible tool
 * reports `UNKNOWN_TOOL`. The returned outcome is the same lossless, frozen
 * snapshot final observers receive. Cancellation
 * arriving after entry and before final result materialization skips a
 * not-yet-started body with `ABORTED_BEFORE_DISPATCH` or replaces a
 * successful started outcome with `ABORTED`; already-started work is still
 * drained and may retain a tool-owned structured error.
 * @param exec - the typed same-process call input. The registry assigns its
 *   correlation token before policy begins.
 * @returns the materialized final result.

### `tools/*` events

<a id="toolschange--emit"></a>

#### `tools/change` — emit

A tool was registered or unregistered, or a scoped restriction changed (the available tool set changed — possibly for one scope only). An UNFILTERED registry-subject notification, deliberately not scope-filtered dispatch: a global change concerns every agent's next assembly, so a scoped listener subscribing here sees every change, not just its own scope's.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * A tool was registered or unregistered, or a scoped restriction changed

 * UNFILTERED registry-subject notification, deliberately not scope-filtered
 * dispatch: a global change concerns every agent's next assembly, so a

 * scope's.

<a id="toolsexecute--waterfall"></a>

#### `tools/execute` — waterfall

Around-dispatch waterfall for timeout, retry, or metrics. `next()` returns a normalized result; wrappers may change only `exec.signal`, while call identity remains immutable. The registry re-fuses the original caller signal before the body, so replacement cannot detach caller cancellation; wrappers must still restore their signal and reach quiescence. Scope-filtered dispatch (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-scope`): agent-scoped listeners receive only that agent's calls.

<a id="toolspost-execute--waterfall"></a>

#### `tools/post-execute` — waterfall

Accept, replace, enrich, or block a normalized dispatch result. `next()` accepts it unchanged; thrown tools still reach this waterfall as errors. Async listeners must observe `exec.signal`; after they settle, caller cancellation replaces only a successful accepted outcome with the code selected by whether the tool body was invoked. Scope-filtered dispatch (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-scope`): agent-scoped listeners receive only that agent's calls.

<a id="toolspre-execute--waterfall"></a>

#### `tools/pre-execute` — waterfall

Allow, deny, cancel, or ask before dispatch. `next()` delegates to allow; `cancel` selects the canonical pre-dispatch cancellation result, and missing approval support turns `ask` into denial. Async gates must observe `exec.signal`; the registry rechecks cancellation after they settle but never abandons their promise. Scope-filtered dispatch (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-scope`): agent-scoped listeners receive only that agent's calls.

<a id="toolsptc-dispatch-log--waterfall"></a>

#### `tools/ptc-dispatch-log` — waterfall

Allow a listener to replace content in the DURABLE LOG COPY of one `run_code` sub-dispatch outcome before the bridge appends its `tool/ptc-dispatch` event. `next()` keeps the content unchanged; a listener may return replacement blocks (e.g. the spill policy's preview + locator for an oversized text result). Only the logged copy is affected — the program already received the complete value, and the model sees neither. A throwing listener is contained: the bridge falls back to logging the original settled content. Scope-filtered dispatch (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-scope`): agent-scoped listeners receive only that agent's dispatches.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
