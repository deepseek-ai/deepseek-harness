# Sessions

English | [中文](session.zh.md)

The in-memory, event-sourced model of [dsh-session](../../packages/core/session). A `Session` is an **append-only log** of typed `SessionEvent`s — the single source of truth for an agent's whole interaction history. The LLM message history is *derived* from the log, never stored separately; replay is re-derivation from the same events. How the log is made **durable** (the persistence seam, backends, crash recovery) is the sibling concern on [persistence.md](persistence.md).

Source: [`packages/core/session/src/types.ts`](../../packages/core/session/src/types.ts)

## `SessionEventMap` — the event vocabulary

The append-only event types. Merge-extensible: a plugin declares extra event types via declaration merging — e.g. the [compaction seam](compaction.md) adds `compaction/start` / `compaction/summary` / `compaction/end`, and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-hook-protocol` adds log-only `hook/invoked` / `hook/result` records for a hook bridge. Like `compaction/*`, these are NOT `SurfaceEventType`s (no `surfaceOp`). The generated [persistence log event catalog](../persistence-catalog.md) enumerates every member — core and merged — with its payload, surface badge, and declaration site.

`UserMessage` is the identified, frozen user-role value shared by ordinary prompts, injected context, steering, and live inbox events. Event wrappers add only event-local position or outcome facts; the loop adds only driver-owned routing state while an item remains pending.

<a id="the-request-header-event-requestheader"></a>

### The request header event: `request/header`

The request envelope — the `EpochHeader` (call config + markers for adapter-supplied defaults + rendered system prompt + assembled tool schemas) — is logged session state, so every conversation request is a pure function of the log (the reconstructability Agent Note). A full `request/header` snapshot with reason `'initial'` or `'resume'` records each loop-instance boundary; a changed request appends a snapshot with reason `'change'`; and an unchanged envelope beginning an explicitly declared message series or following a surface replacement appends a snapshot with reason `'series'`. A changed snapshot carries `startsSeries: true` when that request also begins a series. Ordinary append-only later Turns, further Steps, and retries in the same model-message series inherit the latest snapshot. `foldRequestHeader(events)` reconstructs the header by selecting the latest snapshot. The event is not a `SurfaceEventType`: it produces no LLM message.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Logged request state outside derived history: call config, system prompt, and
 * tools. The latest full `request/header` snapshot reconstructs it; canonical
 * empty optional fields are absent.
 */
interface EpochHeader {
  /** The conversation's call configuration (provider, model, reasoning effort, and sampling scalars). */
  config: LlmCallConfig
  /** Effective config fields materialized from the exact adapter rather than proposed by a caller. */
  adapterDefaults?: LlmCallConfigAdapterDefaults
  /** Rendered system prompt text; absent for a system-less request. */
  system?: string
  /** Assembled tool schemas; absent for a tool-less request. */
  tools?: ToolSchema[]
}
```

Canonical form represents an empty system prompt or tool list as an absent field, matching how requests are built. Legacy v0 logs containing the legacy `request/header-delta` event or its full-snapshot `fallback` reason are rejected at seed, append, and persistence-load boundaries rather than replayed incompletely.

### The route capacity event: `request/context`

The context metadata of the route a request resolved to is separate logged state, appended beside `request/header` inside the same step and only when the provider, model, or capacity differs from the previous record. It stays outside `EpochHeader` because that type is the reconstruction contract compared field-wise by `headerEquals`: capacity describes a route, not a request input, so folding it in would let a capacity change register as a request-envelope `change` and would pull adapter metadata into the loop's reconstruction invariant. Like `request/header`, it is not a `SurfaceEventType` and produces no LLM message. `session.requestContext()` folds the latest record incrementally. A route whose adapter advertises no capacity is recorded with `contextWindow` absent, so the new record clears an older route's capacity.

```ts type-equiv
/** Registration-bound metadata for one resolved model route. */
interface RequestContext {
  /** Registered provider route the metadata belongs to. */
  provider: string
  /** Provider-owned model id the metadata belongs to. */
  model: string
  /** Maximum combined request and response context in tokens, when advertised. */
  contextWindow?: number
}
```

## `SessionEvent<T>` — one log entry

A proper discriminated union over `type` (not independent `type`/`data` unions), so `switch (event.type)` narrows `event.data` without casts. `seq` is the monotonic position in the log (`seq = log.length`); `time` is epoch ms.

```ts type-equiv
/** Sequence number of one existing event in a Session log. */
type SessionSeq = BrandedNumber<'SessionSeq'>
```

```ts type-equiv
/** A Session log gap, prefix length, or read offset, which may equal the event count. */
type SessionLogOffset = BrandedNumber<'SessionLogOffset'>
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Inclusive Session event watermark, or `-1` before any event exists. */
type SessionSeqCursor = SessionSeq | -1
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One existing Session event position, or explicit absence. */
type OptionalSessionSeq = SessionSeq | null
```

`SessionSeq(value)` and `SessionLogOffset(value)` admit only non-negative safe integers and reject negative zero. They add compile-time brands without changing the serialized number; arithmetic returns an ordinary `number` that callers must admit again through the constructor for its intended role.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One immutable entry in the session log.
 *
 * A proper discriminated union over `type` (not independent `type`/`data`
 * unions), so `switch (event.type)` narrows `event.data` without casts.
 *
 * The {@link sourceEventSeqs} and {@link surfaceOp} fields are conditional:
 * they only exist on {@link SurfaceEventType} variants (`user/message`,
 * `assistant/message`, `tool/result`).
 * Non-surface events (boundary markers, attempts, errors) never carry
 * surface metadata — the compiler enforces this at `Session.append()`
 * call sites.
 */
type SessionEvent<T extends SessionEventType = SessionEventType> = {
  [K in SessionEventType]: {
    type: K
    /** Monotonic sequence number within the session. */
    seq: SessionSeq
    /** Unix epoch milliseconds. */
    time: number
    data: SessionEventMap[K]
    /**

     * silently dropping the event, because an unrecognized required event may
     * change how the rest of the log is interpreted. A writer sets `true` only
     * on purely informational records whose loss cannot affect reconstruction;
     * defaulting to required means a forgotten marker over-refuses (an
     * inconvenience) rather than silently resuming a gutted session.
     */
    ignorable?: true
  } & (K extends SurfaceEventType ? {
    /**
     * Seq numbers of earlier events that this event cites as sources, such as
     * the surface nodes shadowed by a compaction replacement. A v2
     * `assistant/message` embeds its provider stream and cannot carry this field.
     */
    sourceEventSeqs?: SessionSeq[]
    /** How this event entered the surface; absent for non-surface events. */
    surfaceOp?: SurfaceOp
  } : object)
}[T]
```

`SessionEventType = keyof SessionEventMap`. Because `SessionEventMap` is merge-extensible, switches over `SessionEvent` must NOT use `assertNever` — a plugin-added variant is a valid unknown value; handle the known cases and fall through `default`.

V2 `assistant/message` embeds its provider stream and cannot carry `sourceEventSeqs`. User and tool surface events may cite a complete non-empty set of unique earlier events when their provenance or replacement operation requires it.

## Surface types

The three message-producing types (`SurfaceEventType` — `user/message`, `assistant/message`, `tool/result`) carry surface metadata declaring how they join the ordered derived surface. See the [session surface Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-06-18-session-surface.md).

### `SurfaceEventType` — the message-producing subset of event types

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * The subset of {@link SessionEventType} values whose events produce LLM
 * messages and are eligible to appear on the ordered surface. Only these
 * event types may carry {@link SurfaceOp}; user and tool events may also cite
 * earlier sources through {@link SessionEvent.sourceEventSeqs}.
 */
type SurfaceEventType =
  | 'user/message'
  | 'assistant/message'
  | 'tool/result'
```

### `SurfaceOp` — how an event entered the surface

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * How a session event entered the ordered surface. Only valid on
 * {@link SurfaceEventType} events.
 *
 * - `'append'`: added to the tail — normal path for user/assistant/tool
 *   messages.
 * - `{ op: 'replace', start, end }`: replaces surface nodes from `start`
 *   (inclusive) through `end` (inclusive) with this node. Both must exist as
 *   surface nodes in the current surface. `start === end` replaces a single
 *   node. The node's {@link SessionEvent.sourceEventSeqs} must include every
 *   shadowed surface node. Used by compaction; any surface-replacing producer
 *   may use it.
 */
type SurfaceOp =
  | 'append'
  | { op: 'replace'; start: SessionSeq; end: SessionSeq }
```

`'append'` is the normal tail-append path. `replace` shadows surface entries from `start` through `end` inclusive (both must be valid surface seqs; `start === end` replaces a single entry) and inserts the new event in their place.

### `SurfaceIntent` — the parameter to `session.append()`

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Surface placement and cited source-event seqs for {@link Session.append}. Required on
 * message-producing events and forbidden on log-only events.
 */
type SurfaceIntent<T extends SurfaceEventType = SurfaceEventType> = {
  surfaceOp: SurfaceOp
} & (T extends 'assistant/message' ? {
  /** V2 Assistant messages embed their provider stream instead of citing source events. */
  sourceEventSeqs?: never
} : {
  /** Complete non-empty set of known earlier source-event seqs. */
  sourceEventSeqs?: SessionSeq[]
})
```

Required for `SurfaceEventType` events — every message-producing event must declare how it joins the surface, the sole source of derived model history. A human-facing transcript is the other projection and reads the log's append-origin events instead, because the surface deliberately shadows the ranges a replacement summarizes (`isAppendSurfaceEvent` in [dsh-session](../../packages/core/session/README.md)). Non-surface types reject it at compile time.

`assistant/message` cannot carry `sourceEventSeqs`; its `stream` owns exact provider evidence. Other surface events omit the field when they cite no earlier event and use a complete non-empty list when they do.

### `SessionSurface` — the live readonly surface projection

`Session.surface` returns the session's stable `SessionSurface` view. The same incremental manager validates append candidates before commit and advances this projection from committed events; callers can observe membership and replacement generation but cannot invoke validation.

`SurfaceManager(log, baseSeq?)` can instead fold a contiguous loaded window whose first event has the absolute sequence `baseSeq`. Every event remains contiguous in that absolute sequence space, and a replacement that crosses the window head fails because its declared range is absent.

```ts type-equiv
/** Readonly live projection of the message-producing session events. */
interface SessionSurface {
  /** Current surface event sequences in model-visible order. */
  readonly nodes: readonly SessionSeq[]
  /** Monotonic count of committed positional replacements. */
  readonly replaceGeneration: number
}
```

### `SurfaceFoldReplacement` and `SurfaceFoldResult` — a complete surface replay

`foldSurface(events)` returns detached current event sequences together with the actual sequences shadowed by each declared replacement range. The live manager uses the same transitions without retaining replacement history. Its `replaceGeneration` increments for each committed replacement so incremental consumers can distinguish pure tail growth from a rewrite.

```ts type-equiv
/** One replacement operation observed while folding a session surface. */
interface SurfaceFoldReplacement {
  /** Seq of the event that replaced the prior surface range. */
  seq: SessionSeq
  /** Declared inclusive start seq of the replaced surface range. */
  start: SessionSeq
  /** Declared inclusive end seq of the replaced surface range. */
  end: SessionSeq
  /** Actual surface entries removed by the operation, in surface order. */
  shadowedSeqs: SessionSeq[]
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Complete result of replaying the surface operations in a session log. */
interface SurfaceFoldResult {
  /** Current surface event sequences in model-visible order. */
  nodes: SessionSeq[]
  /** Replacement operations in event order. */
  replacements: SurfaceFoldReplacement[]
}
```

## `Session` public API

The body-stripped declaration keeps the plain class's detached factory, state accessors, append method, and history projections synchronized with source. Store operations remain in the generated [`ctx.sessions` section](#ctxsessions--sessionstore).

```ts public-api
/**
 * An event-sourced session: an append-only log of {@link SessionEvent}s.

  deriveEventMessage(event: SessionEvent): Message | null;

```

## Derived history: `deriveMessages()` and `deriveEventMessage()`

`Session.deriveMessages()` projects the event log into the `Message[]` the model sees — cached (each surface node projected once, when first seen; a surface rewrite rebuilds) and frozen (a fresh array per call over shared, deep-frozen messages, so mutating logged history through a projection is unrepresentable). `deriveEventMessage(event)` is the per-node pure function the fold applies — public so external reconstructors and the dev invariant project a log prefix with exactly the same rules and cannot disagree with the cache. The projection rules:

- `user/message` → a user message carrying exact `content`; an optional envelope remains log-only display metadata.
- `assistant/message` → an assistant message with the provider and model that produced it plus optional adapter-private replay state. Its embedded compact stream is replay, usage, and UI evidence rather than a second message. An **empty-content** `assistant/message` is also skipped — a max-tokens step cut off with no content still records an `assistant/message` to hold its stream, usage, provider, and model, but a content-less assistant turn must not enter the provider transcript.
- `tool/result` → a user message carrying a `tool-result` block.
- `user/message` (injected context, i.e. non-`user` source) → a user-role message carrying its `content` verbatim at its chronological position; its typed source names the producer and carries any producer-specific data.

Everything else (`turn/*`, `step/*`, `assistant/attempt`, plugin-owned `llm/retry`) is structural and does not project into a message. Token accounting expands the embedded stream on each `assistant/message` or `assistant/attempt`, while the message's top-level `usage` remains the committed-message authority when present. A failed model-request attempt therefore retains its provider usage without fabricating an assistant message. Current logical validation rejects request headers and assistant messages that omit provider/model instead of guessing a route; supported historical representations are normalized and validated by their adjacent format edge before a current Session exists.

## Live-session fork API

`ctx.sessions.create(id, { seed, meta })` is the low-level replay/fork primitive. For ordinary live-session forks, `SessionStore` exposes one policy API:

- `fork(source, boundary?, childSessionId?)` accepts a live `Session` object or live `SessionId`, selects source events through the inclusive `SessionSeq` boundary (default: current last event), requires the selected prefix to end outside an open turn, then creates a live child session with deep-cloned seed events, `parentSession`, `isSeeded: true`, the exact `inheritedEventCount`, and inherited `cwd`.

An explicit `boundary` lets callers fork from any stable between-turn position, including a previous `turn/end` or a later standalone log-only event, even if the source has newer events or an open current turn. The API rejects a prefix that ends inside an open turn instead of clipping silently. Broader execution-relation sanity stays in the existing `dsh-invariants` plugin and persistence repair path rather than being duplicated in `fork()`. `dsh-subagent-fork-in-process` keeps its completed-prefix clipping because tool-time delegation usually starts while the parent turn is open; ordinary session branching should make the requested boundary explicit.

## Why a turn ended: `TurnEndReasonMap`

`turn/start` has no trigger field. The entered `user/message` batch records what entered each step, `llm/retry` records request recovery, and idle injection remains pending until a waking delivery reaches a later pre-step. Live turns retain the typed [`AgentCancelCause`](core.md#the-agent-handle) that stopped the driver; persistence uses the additional `{ kind: 'legacy' }` cause only when importing a supported coarse cancellation record that did not store its caller.

```ts type-equiv
/** Durable cancellation cause, including imports whose original coarse record carried no cause. */
type TurnEndCancelCause = AgentCancelCause | { readonly kind: 'legacy' }
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Why a turn ended. Merge-extensible sum type.
 */
interface TurnEndReasonMap {
  completed: { kind: 'completed' }
  /** A cancellation request interrupted the live turn. */
  aborted: { kind: 'aborted'; reason: TurnEndCancelCause }

  blocked: { kind: 'blocked' }
  /**
   * The turn failed. `error` is always a structured failure: the `LlmError`
   * facts verbatim, or `{ message: errorChain(error), code: 'UNKNOWN' }`
   * flattened from any other error.
   */
  error: { kind: 'error'; error: LlmFailure }
  /** At least one step reached its output-token ceiling, even if a plugin continued the turn. */
  'max-tokens': { kind: 'max-tokens' }
  /**
   * A crash-orphaned turn was closed after the fact: agent-loop resume appends
   * this closer for a stored log whose last turn never ended, and session-query
   * synthesizes it on cold reads. The loop never emits this marker live, and
   * the events recorded before the crash remain intact.
   */
  interrupted: { kind: 'interrupted' }
}
```

`max-tokens` mirrors the model-call `FinishReason` of the same name: any `max-tokens` step in a turn makes the whole turn end `max-tokens` rather than `completed` (the cut-short fact wins over a later continuation), so a consumer can tell a clean stop from a truncated one. Cancellation and errors remain distinct outcomes. `interrupted` is the one reason no loop emits—it is synthesized by crash recovery (see [persistence.md](persistence.md)). The map is merge-extensible.

## Execution enclosure and standalone events

A turn encloses one model-loop execution, not the whole session log. AgentLoop records injected `user/message` events only from entering pre-step batches inside a turn; plugin-owned log-only events may still appear between `turn/end` and the next `turn/start`, consuming event seqs without incrementing turn numbers. Persistence admits every contiguous accepted event into a bounded durable batch, while crash repair closes only a genuinely open trailing turn. A producer that needs an immediate durability barrier explicitly awaits `ctx.sessions.flush(session)`.

The optional `dsh-session/invariant` companion enforces the relations owned by core: turn and step numbering, execution-event enclosure, and same-step tool call/result pairing. Merge-extensible event relations belong to the plugin that declares them, so core does not reject an unknown event merely because no turn is open. See [the standalone-event decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/simplification/2026-07-28-remove-synthetic-log-only-turns.md).

## The end-seed boundary: `session/end-seed`

A fresh fork constructor requires its seed to equal the inherited prefix and appends `session/end-seed { inherited: true }` at the exact durable cut. A restore retains that tagged marker and appends an ordinary `session/end-seed {}` only when its complete stored seed does not already end in a marker. Both forms are log-only and produce no message; `Session`'s constructor is the only legitimate writer.

For fork lineage, locate the LAST marker whose payload carries `inherited: true`; v2 decoding requires it exactly when `SessionHeader.isSeeded` is true and derives `inheritedEventCount` from its seq. For lifecycle ownership, locate the last `session/end-seed` of either form. Reopening a seed that already ends in any marker does not append another ordinary marker.

It exists because seed history and live work are otherwise byte-identical, which defeats any plugin owning a standalone open/close bracket: an unmatched `compaction/start` reads the same whether the writer crashed mid-compaction or is compacting right now. An opening marker before `session/end-seed` came from the constructor seed and belongs to an ended lifecycle, whatever ended it (a crash, a succeeding process, or a fork out of a still-running parent), so its owner may treat it as dead. That covers only brackets *this* session inherited: a concurrently live session holding an open bracket over the same history has its own boundary elsewhere, so tolerating concurrent writers needs a liveness signal beyond the log. Core writes the boundary and reads nothing from it — a bracket's vocabulary stays with its owning plugin, which is why crash repair closes turn/step/tool boundaries and never `compaction/*`.

Consumers that order Sessions by human activity exclude this boundary: picking a Session up is not work, so ordering by the log tail would float every opened Session to the top.

## Plugin-contributed log-only events

A plugin may declaration-merge extra `SessionEventMap` types. These are **log-only**: NOT `SurfaceEventType`s (they carry no `surfaceOp` and contribute nothing to derived history). Their owner decides whether they belong to an open execution turn or may stand between turns, and enforces any relation in its own invariant companion. The generated [persistence log event catalog](../persistence-catalog.md) enumerates every core and plugin-contributed event; the compaction seam's `compaction/*` semantics are discussed on [compaction.md](compaction.md).

When several events in one plugin-owned family assemble into one Web Client Conversation Node, every start, update, result, resource, or interruption event in that family carries or independently derives the same stable business id. This requirement applies to correlated Node families, not to every Session event; it lets the client group each event without guessing from adjacency or scanning history. See the [Conversation subsystem](conversation.md).

The hook bridges' `hook/invoked` / `hook/result` pairs (from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-hook-protocol`) correlate by `handlerId`. `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop` fire inside the loop's open turn, so their `hook/*` records are turn-enclosed by construction. `SessionStart` gets no `hook/*` record because it runs before turn 1; its context remains pending in the inbox until a waking delivery opens a turn.

## Durability contract

What a persistence backend relies on: the durable log persists every event losslessly, and every Assistant attempt is one `assistant/message` or `assistant/attempt` whose embedded compact stream preserves the original timed chunks. `seq` stays contiguous across these settlements and all interleaved events. A backend may choose its own storage framing for an event batch as long as a handle's `read()` returns the exact appended events; current JSONL v2 writes one row per event (see [persistence.md](persistence.md)). All `event.data` must be JSON-serializable; `Session.append` enforces this at the source (throwing on non-serializable data), so a bad event never enters the log and `session.snapshotEvents()` always equals what a backend can persist. Adding an event type that carries non-serializable data, corrupts core execution nesting, or violates its owner's declared relation is a breaking change to the on-disk format.

The backends that consume this contract are on [persistence.md](persistence.md).

## Remote catalog and workspace opening

`ModelCatalog` is the Host-generation model directory returned by `session/modelCatalog`: it carries the deployment default, routable provider ids, successful provider groups, and isolated provider failures. It is not derived from one Session and remains separate from Session projections.

`SessionOpenWorkspacePathRequest` carries an absolute or workspace-resolved `path`. `SessionOpenWorkspacePathValue` confirms that the Host accepted the native handoff. A Session-aware Client resolves relative paths against its current Session cwd when known; the controller hands the path to the opener unchanged and reports invalid requests, cancellation, and opener failures through the Session Remote error vocabulary.

### `ctx.sessions` — `SessionStore`

In-memory session store (`ctx.sessions`).

Persistence is intentionally not implemented here — the agent lifecycle attaches a session-log writer to each published session's write handle; a session published outside that lifecycle persists nothing.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Create a session owned by the calling fiber: disposing that fiber stops
 * event notification and removes the session from the store. `options.seed`
 * populates the session with a copy of those events (replay/fork);
 * `options.meta` attaches creation metadata (validated absolute `cwd`, seed
 * and parent lineage, and delegation depth) as the immutable
 * {@link SessionHeader} (the store fills `version`/`id`/`createdAt`).
 *
 * For an agent whose session must be torn down IN ORDER with its loop (so the
 * loop's final events are published before the store attachment ends), do NOT use this
 * — fold the session lifecycle into the agent's own effect via
 * {@link prepare} + {@link enter} + {@link announce} (see
 * `dsh-agent-loop`'s creation transaction).
 *
 * @param id - the session id; omitted, the store mints `session-<n>`.
 * @param options - seed events and/or creation metadata for the header.
 * @returns the live session, already entered and announced.
 * @throws if a session with `id` already exists, metadata is not a plain
 *   lossless-JSON record with valid scalar fields, or `meta.cwd` is a
 *   non-absolute path (storage backends key directories off it).

/**
